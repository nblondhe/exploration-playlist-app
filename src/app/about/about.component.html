                    Exploration allows users to find new music by building intentional, flowing playlists based off of music they already love.
                  </p>
                  <p>One of my favorite features of Spotify is the delivery of recommendations based
                    on listening habits over a time. By providing recommendations based off of user-saved tracks, 
                    Exploration exposes the same awesome recommendation engine with greater choice and granularity for the user.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I hope Exploration leads you to excellent music finds!
