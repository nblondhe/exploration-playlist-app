                      Exploration allows users to find new music by building intentional, smooth-flowing playlists based off of music they already love.
                    </p>
                  <p>One of my favorite features of Spotify is the delivery of recommendations based 
                    on listening habits over a time.</p>
                    
                    <p>I wanted to access the same awesome recommendation engine, but with greater choice and granularity. Exploration 
                      gathers a user's most recent saved tracks and provides recommendations, showing exactly which user-saved track they are derived from. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope Exploration leads you to excellent music finds!
